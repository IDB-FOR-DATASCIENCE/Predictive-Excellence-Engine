# Predictive-Excellence-Engine
In this notebook, we will create an AI and time serie driven forecasting engine based on a set of 5 AI models and 5 time series models and employ several algorithms to perform feature engennering and selection on a multivaraite time series dataset. We are trying to find the best drivers of the HK flat price using various macro economics data.The dataset we are using is the 'HK macroeconomics data' from Kaggle. It is a daily dataset starting from 2nd January 2003 and goes on till 26th November 2019. The target variable is 'Private Domestic (Price Index)' and there 12 features which can help us forecast HK flat price.
